		<h1>My Story</h1>
		<h2>Quick info</h1>
		<p>My name is Louise Bruwer, and most people just call me Louise. Some like to get on my nerves by using the nickname <q><i>Lu</i></q>, but I much rather prefer just my name. I was born on the 9<sup>th</sup>of April 2004,<small>somewhere in the late hours of the night</small>. I've lived in Pretoria my whole life, and know this place like the back of my hand! But although I love it here, I would really like to move out of the country one day, and start a new life somewhere else.</p>
		<h2>Favourites</h2>
		<h3>Books</h3>
		<p>I am not really an avid reader, the only books I've read in the past 10 years are prescribed books we <b><em>had</em></b> to read in school... so needless to say, there is no favourite. Sorry to disappoint.</p> 
		<h3>Movies / shows</h3>
		<p>I rarely watch TV these days, so my favourite movies and shows are mostly those that I've held close to my heart from childhood. It's impossible to pick a single favourite, but the names that come up first &#40; In no specific order &#41; are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><abbr title = "How To Train Your Dragon"> <em> HTTYD </em></abbr></li>
			<li><em>Rio</em></li>
			<li><em>Phineas and Ferb</em></li>
			<li><em>The edge of tomorrow</em> &#40; most recent &#41;</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Activities</h3>
		<p>My hobbies are mainly anything to do with physical activities. I love to train, whether it's going for a run or going to the gym, I just want to be active! Something that is on my bucket list is inviting a bunch of friends and doing a team<strong>Warrior Race</strong></span>together.
		<h3>Quote</h3>
		<p>My favourite quote, and one that I try to live by everyday, is not from a book, movie, or game. It is one I came across while scrolling through social media a few months ago. It is: 
		<blockquote><q>You are what you do, not what you say you’ll do.</q></blockquote></p>
		<p>It motivates me to actually do the things that I tell myself I want to do, whether it’s studying or going for a run.</p>
